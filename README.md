# Automated unattended ISPConfig installer
Based on [The Perfect Server - Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) with Apache, PHP, MySQL, PureFTPD, BIND, Postfix, Dovecot and ISPConfig 3.1](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/perfect-server-ubuntu-18.04-with-apache-php-myqsl-pureftpd-bind-postfix-doveot-and-ispconfig/).
## Installation
```
bash <(curl -skL https://github.com/zhubanRuban/ispconfig-installer/raw/master/ispconfig-installer.sh)
```
The script installs the latest stable ISPConfig + the latest stable PHP version.
After the installation the script prints ISPConfig login details.
## Compatibility
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04. Should be working on new versions as well.
## Alternatives
[ISPConfig autoinstaller and setup](https://github.com/servisys/ispconfig_setup): supports more OS, but is not fully unattended.
